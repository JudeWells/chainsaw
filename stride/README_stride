In order to install stride on a Unix/Linux system with gcc follow these steps. Other compilers need slight modifications of the Makefile.

Download the stride stand-alone program source code

Create a directory wherever/stride and copy the tar ball there

Unpack the tar ball:

```
tar -zxf stride.tgz
```

Compile stride

```
make
```

Now you have a binary file stride in your directory, you can copy it to /usr/local/bin or add the current directory to your path to use it system-wide

Update the variable stride_path in get_predictions.py to point to your stride install location.
